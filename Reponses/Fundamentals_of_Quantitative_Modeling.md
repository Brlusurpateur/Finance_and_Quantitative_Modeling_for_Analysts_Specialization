--> Module 1: Introduction to Models Quiz

1. Which of the following features is typically NOT associated with a quantitative model for a business process?

    A 100% accurate representation of the business process.

2. For which activity(ies) might you use a quantitative model?

(i)              Forecasting
(ii)            Targeting
(iii)           Optimization

    (i), (ii) and (iii)

3. Which of the following activities is typically NOT a part of the modeling process?

    Creating a model, so that the output always agrees with our prior expectations

4. If a model gives a different output even when the inputs are the same, then what sort of model must it be?

    Probabilistic

5. From a modeling perspective, what is the key difference between a digital and an analog thermometer? 

    The digital thermometer provices a discrete reading of the temperature, whereas the analog provides a continuous one

6. In the model  y=3 e^(0.02 t) , where t is measured in months and y measures the number of customers in thousands, what is the best interpretation of the coefficient 0.02?

    The monthly customer growth rate is approximately 2%

7. What is the defining characteristic of the linear model y =3+4 x, where x is the number of units produced and y is the time in hours it takes to produce them?

    The rate of change in y is constant at 4 hours per unit

8. For which of the following business processes is a log function particularly useful in modeling the output?

    A process that exhibits diminishing returns to scale

9. If you wanted to model a business process that looked like the graph below, then which modeling function would you suggest?

    Exponential

10. When would you choose to use a dynamic model for a business process? 

   When there is specific interest in the state to state transitions of the process
